TODO: Replace "Lab Title" with the actual title of the lab, and
"http://hyperlink.to.lab" with a hyperlink to the lab in the LMS, and then
remove the italic enclosures surrounding the hyperlink.

This repository defines the Integrated Digital Lab (IDL) in markdown format for
the *[Lab Title](http://hyperlink.to.lab)* lab.

The IDL itself is defined in the [idl.md](/idl.md) file.

If the lab repository contains any associated videos and screenshots, they can
be found in the [videos](/videos) and [screenshots](/screenshots) folders,
respectively.

To learn how to create your own IDL in Markdown lab, see
